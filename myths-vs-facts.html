                            <p>I lead a team, I strive to inspire them and we are a family. I started out working with the products we sell, but then realised sales was my thing and I’ve continued to progress. Members of my team have gone on to do all sorts of different roles, such as programme managers, training executives and area sales managers.</p>
                            <p>They’ve learnt how to build relationships, influence people, negotiate, time manage (oh, and see the world!). To get in to a senior role it’s all about graft and trying new things, putting yourself out there, going to events, helping in other departments, building external and internal relationships and believing in yourself and your team.

                        <h1>Sector in Focus: Aviation</h1>
                        <p><b>The captain might be the one in the cockpit, but there are hundreds of different jobs involved in aviation, making sure every step of a passenger’s journey goes smoothly, from when they arrive at the airport to the moment they touch down in another country.</b></p>
                        <p>Check-in staff greet customers at the airport and manage the boarding process, while cabin crew often have the most interaction with the public as they look after passengers’ welfare while in the air – and occasionally get to stay and explore the destination before they fly back!</p>
                        <p>Yet like any large, multinational company, airlines employ thousands of people in their offices. They include IT developers who make complex websites as user-friendly as possible, training managers who ensure staff are up to speed on changing rules and regulations, marketers who design creative TV adverts and operations teams who manage the logistics of keeping a huge aircraft fleet up and running.</p>
                        <p>The UK’s busy airports have just as many wide-ranging roles, from staff in shops, restaurants or business-class lounges to air traffic control teams who guide pilots on and off the runway and highly trained engineers who oversee aircraft safety. Security guards and ground handling teams also work hard to keep passengers – and their luggage – flowing through the airport as efficiently as possible.</p>

                            <p><b>is a senior cabin crew member and cabin crew representative for Jet2.com, based at Manchester Airport</b></p>
                            <p>I joined Jet2.com in 2016 as cabin crew and quickly progressed to the role of senior cabin crew. In this role, I was responsible for the safety and comfort of all customers while on board our aircraft, as well as training other members of cabin crew.</p>
                            <p>In addition, I also delivered sales by promoting and selling our inflight products, provided a VIP experience for all customers and, as a senior member of the team, made sure that I led by example. There is ample opportunity to develop as cabin crew at Jet2.com as my career path shows. As well as growing in the cabin service side of the business, there are other opportunities to develop too. In fact, I have just taken up the new position of cabin crew representative where I will be responsible for helping to engage and retain cabin crew while acting as a representative to senior management. When it comes to a career as cabin crew, I am proof that the sky really is the limit!</p>

                            <p><b>is social and content executive  for Virgin Atlantic</b></p>
                            <p>I started with Virgin Atlantic this year as the company’s social and content executive. Coming out of university, I wasn’t completely sure about the type of role I wanted to go into within marketing, but soon realised social was my passion. </p>
                            <p>Virgin Atlantic is the perfect fit for my love of travel. It challenges me to see the world differently and is a great supporter and advocate on so many important causes. Aviation is a broad sector with many moving parts and endless content opportunities, I love that no two days are the same, and getting to work in a fast-paced collaborative environment consistently challenges me to develop my skillset and gain new ones. </p>
                            <p>My favourite days involve collaborating with our uniformed crew by creating a variety of TikToks for our channel – the days are always high-energy and a great way to get destination tips! </p>
                            <p>I’m still relatively early on in my career but I hope to stay with Virgin Atlantic and develop my career within social media – with technology constantly evolving, who knows how we’ll be holidaying in 20 years.</p>
